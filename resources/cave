                Injected shellcode goes here
                  inside the .tls section 

1. Open file to read and write
2. Extract PE file information
3. Find a suitably-sized code cave
4. Tailor shellcode to the target application
5. Acquire any additional data for the shellcode to function
6. Inject the shellcode into the application
7. Modify the application's original entry point to the start of the shellcode

Find the padding area between the .text segment and the next segment in the program (that is usually .data).
Append the payload code to the end of the .text segment (in that padding area)
Patch the ELF binary to run the injected coded at start up (modify the ELF entry point)
Patch the payload to return execution to the original ELF entry point
